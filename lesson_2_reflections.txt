What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

there are no commits
Files need to be added
I need to check the status to confirm it is really now a git repository

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
better tracking the changes.... make tests, before doing the commit as a package and  giving order to the files to be commited
